<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

According to <a href="https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/specialpublications/nist.sp.800-83r1.pdf">NIST</a> malware detection is a crucial factor in cybersecurity. Not only organizations
but whoever uses a technological appliance should strive to detect and validate malware
incidents rapidly to minimize the damage. Our goal is to develop a Malware Detection
System (MDS) able to provide a significant contribution to defense against malicious attacks.
Instead of traditional MDS that uses feature extractions ML algorithms, we thought that
it could be interesting and challenging to develop a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
trained to classify an executable file as malware or benign just analyzing the corresponding
image. Traditionally, most MDS are based on feature vectors, which contain essential
characteristics of malware. The two main categories of MDS are static and dynamic. In
static analysis, malicious software is analyzed without executing it. The detection patterns
used in static analysis include string signature, byte-sequence n-grams and syntactic library
call. Instead, in dynamic analysis, malicious software is analyzed while being executed in
a controlled environment (e.g., virtual machine, simulator, emulator, or sandbox). Before
executing the malware samples, appropriate monitoring tools like Process Monitor or Capture
BAT are installed and activated; thus to what have just been reported dynamic analysis is
time consuming and computationally intensive.
